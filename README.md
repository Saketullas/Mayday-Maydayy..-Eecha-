MAYDAY: Track Tiny Pests, Big Moves MAYDAY is a quirky, experimental web app that turns your device's camera into a powerful motion detector. It doesn't just spot movementâ€”it highlights and tracks it in real-time, from a buzzing housefly to a person walking across the room. See the action as it happens, so you never miss a thing.
